# IMPORTANT UPDATE!!!

I have begun using Arch Linux (btw) and I have made many breaking changes. If you did not heed my advice, instead cloning and blindly copying my dotfiles, STBY ig then.

I have also stopped updating my i3 dotfiles. personally I have all my fancy i3 packages on Arch, but I just don't use it at the moment, since I am doing the hyprland challenge.

# README

Useful shell scripts and dotfiles for Linux

I currently use these dotfiles on Fedora 38, but they should be pretty distro-agnostic.

Included are configs for i3 window manager and the Hyprland compositor, as well as bash/zsh, gtk, picom, nvim, Kitty, rofi, waybar -- basically all the nerd shit TWM users like nowadays.

Don't just clone this repo and copy my config -- *learn* from it. *Experiment*. Whenever you aren't growing, you're dying. (Is that how that saying goes?)

Questions? Write an issue. I doubt those are all that useful for anything else on a dotfiles repo.
