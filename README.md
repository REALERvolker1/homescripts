Useful shell scripts and dotfiles for Linux

I currently am using these dotfiles on Fedora 38.

Included are configs for i3 window manager and the Hyprland compositor, as well as bash/zsh, gtk, picom, nvim, Kitty, rofi, waybar -- basically all the nerd shit TWM users like nowadays.

Don't just clone this repo and copy my config -- *learn* from it. *Experiment*. Whenever you aren't growing, you're dying. (Is that how that saying goes?)
